* docker-g5k

This the first attempt to use Docker for provisioning experiments in Grid'50000.
The idea is to run Docker images as natively as possible and as transparently as possible.

The workflow would be to have an special base image which boots with [[http://kadeploy3.gforge.inria.fr/][Kadeploy]] and
another tools will run docker, pull and image and start with special parameters to run as
closer to the machine as possible

This repository will serve as well as a way to document all the experiences of making
a certain type of software stack deployable with Docker.

This repository contain:

- Deployment scripts to setup docker images on Grid'5000 nodes

- Dockerfiles that were successfully deployable on Grid'5000

* Dockerfiles

- Distem [[./distem/index.org][here
]]
